So we're already nearly 5 years into the <a href="http://www.ciclavia.org/">CicLAvia</a> thing, haven't we had enough already?<br />
<br />
OF COURSE NOT!<br />
<br />
Just when we got over the <a href="http://militantangeleno.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-militants-epic-militant-ciclavia.html">last CicLAvia</a>, along comes the XIVth edition of America's largest open streets event (Oh you know it, baby), and the third of four this year (<i>But wait a minute, the last Epic Militant CicLAvia Tour was number 10.0, why is this one 4.1? You might ask. Well, The Militant categorizes his CicLAvia routes into unique versions of routes, and since this route is basically a modification of <a href="http://militantangeleno.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-militants-epic-militant-ciclavia.html">the fourth unique route from April 2013</a> (The legendary 17-mile "To The Sea" edition), The Militant categorizes Sunday's route as 4.1. Got it?</i>). But even though this one is but a slight change from the Epic Venice Boulevard Route, there's a lot more new sights to see, especially along Washington Boulevard/Washington place, plus some locales he forgot to add during the 4.0 posting. Anyways, you know the drill, Share this link on your Facebooks and Twitters, visit the sights yourselves -- and if you do, Tweet with the hashtag, <b>#EpicCicLAviaTour</b>&nbsp;to stroke The Militant's ego and make him feel like his several days of staying up late at night to research and write all this was worth his while. And most of all, Stay Militant and Enjoy CicLAvia this Sunday! See you or not see you on the streets!<br />
